First, we need to install Node.js to work with TypeScript.

Node.js provides an environment to execute JavaScript outside the browser. Install the latest stable version of Node.js. After installing Node.js, you'll have NPM (Node Package Manager), which helps you install third-party libraries.

Open the command prompt and type the following command to check if Node.js is installed:

`node --version`

This should display the installed version (e.g., `v12.16.3`).

Next, install TypeScript globally using the following command:

`npm install -g typescript`

The `-g` flag indicates a global installation.

After successful installation, verify TypeScript by running:

`tsc --version`

This should display the installed version (e.g., `Version 3.9.2`).

Now you can start working with TypeScript using your favorite editors like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom, etc.
