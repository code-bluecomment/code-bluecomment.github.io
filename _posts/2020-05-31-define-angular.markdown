<p>Angular is basically a framework for building client applications using HTML, CSS, Javascript, or Typescript.</p>
<p>Angular itself is written using Typescript. When compiling angular application transpiles to Javascript code. <strong>Transpiling</strong> is a process of converting the typescript code to javascript.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Need for Angular</span><br /></strong>When we build a complex application using Javascript, it is very difficult to structure, maintain, and test the application. To address these issues we use modern front end frameworks like Angular, React or Vue.js</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Benefits</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Helps to have a clean structure for application</li>
<li>Easy to Unit test</li>
<li>Reusable Code</li>
<li>Traditional javascript are difficult to manage.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The architecture of Angular Application</strong></span><br />The angular application works in front only. Data storing is not the headache of angular. It is the back-end service that helps in data storing. Angular uses API(Application Programming Interface) to interact with backend.<br /><br />First, you can install the typescript and then start setting up your first angular project<br /><a title="Install typescript" href="/post/how-to-install-typescript">Install typescript<br /></a><a title="First Angular Project" href="/post/how-to-create-first-angular-project-using-command-line-interface">Setting up your first Angular Project</a></p>
<p>If you face any issue during the set up of your angular application, kindly drop in the comments section.</p>
