Here we discuss some of the common issues faced by most people when they start hosting their blog using BlogEngine.Net.For the basic installation setting please refer to [setting up BlogEngine](https://blogengine.io/docs/get-started/).

I am talking about the latest version of blogengine as per writing this article i.e version: 3.3.8.0.

1.  Navigate to the ftp folder in which we are suppose to host the website files and upload the zip file downloaded from the website of [blogengine](https://github.com/BlogEngine/BlogEngine.NET/releases/download/v3.3.8.0/3380.zip "Download files").
2.  Unzip the contents of the file.
3.  Allow write permission to the folders **App\_Data** and **Custom.**

4.  Update the trust level in the web.config file, uncomment the line and change the value from **Medium** to **Full**.

5.  Now you will be able to view the site at [http://www.yourdomain.com](http://www.yourdomain.com).  
    Type [http://www.yourdomain.com/admin](http://www.yourdomain.com/admin) to login to the admin panel

    After login you could see a similar screen.
