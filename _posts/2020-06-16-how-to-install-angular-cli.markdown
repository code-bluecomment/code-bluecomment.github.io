You’ve heard about Angular CLI—the powerful command-line tool that promises to streamline your workflow. But what exactly is it, and how do you install it? Let’s embark on this journey together.

## What is Angular CLI and Why Do You Need It?
Angular CLI (**Command Line Interface**) is like a **magic wand** for Angular developers. Instead of manually setting up configurations, installing dependencies, and structuring projects, Angular CLI automates these tasks, allowing developers to focus on writing clean, efficient code.

## How is Angular CLI Different from a Standard Angular Application?
Without Angular CLI, setting up an Angular project requires manually configuring Webpack, TypeScript, and other dependencies. With Angular CLI, a single command generates a fully structured project, complete with best practices baked in. It also provides commands for **building, testing, and deploying** applications effortlessly.

## Installing Angular CLI on Windows & macOS
Before installing Angular CLI, ensure you have Node.js installed, as it provides npm (Node Package Manager), which is required for installation.

### Step 1: Install Node.js
- Visit the official [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) website and download the latest **LTS (Long-Term Support)** version.
- Install Node.js:
    - Windows: Run the `.msi` installer and follow the setup wizard.
    - macOS: Open the `.pkg` file and complete the installation.
- Verify installation by running:

```Bash
node -v
npm -v
```
If both commands return version numbers, Node.js and npm are successfully installed.

### Step 2: Install Angular CLI
Now, let’s install Angular CLI globally:

```Bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```
The `-g` flag ensures Angular CLI is available system-wide.

### Step 3: Verify Installation
Check if Angular CLI is installed correctly: `ng version`

If you see version details, congratulations! You’re ready to create Angular projects.

### Step 4: Create a New Angular Project
Navigate to your desired directory and run:

```Bash
ng new my-angular-app
```
This command sets up a new Angular project with essential configurations.

### Step 5: Run Your Angular Application
Move into your project folder: `cd my-angular-app`

Start the development server: `ng serve`

Visit `http://localhost:4200/` in your browser to see your application live!


## Common Installation Issues & Solutions
Even the smoothest installations can hit roadblocks. Here are some common issues and how to fix them:

### 1. npm Command Not Found
✅ Solution: Ensure Node.js is installed correctly. If issues persist, reinstall Node.js..

### 2. Permission Errors While Installing Angular CLI
✅ Solution: Use administrator mode in Windows or sudo in macOS:

```Bash
sudo npm install -g @angular/cli
```
### 3. 'ng' Command Not Recognized
✅ Solution: Restart the terminal or manually add npm’s global path:

Windows: Add `C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Roaming\npm` to your system’s PATH.

macOS/Linux: Add `export PATH=$PATH:$(npm bin -g)` to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`.

### 4. Incorrect Node.js Version
✅ Solution: Update Node.js using:

```Bash
npm install -g n
n latest
```

## Final Thoughts
Angular CLI is a game-changer for developers, simplifying project setup and management. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, mastering Angular CLI will enhance your workflow and efficiency.
