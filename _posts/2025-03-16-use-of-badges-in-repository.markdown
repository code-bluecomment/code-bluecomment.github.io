Badges from [shields.io](https://shields.io/) are great visual aids for displaying useful information about a Git repository. They help make your repository more appealing and informative at a glance. Let me explain everything in parts:

## Common Tags for Git Repositories
Badges often use the following tags to convey information:

### Build Status:

Indicates whether the latest build is passing or failing.

| View  | ![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen) |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Markdown     | ``` ![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen)``` |


### License: 
Shows the license type of your project.

| View      | ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue) |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Markdown      | ```![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)``` |

### Version: 
Displays the current version of the project.

| View      | ![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.0-blue) |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Markdown      | ```![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.0-blue)``` |

### Dependencies: 
Highlights whether project dependencies are up-to-date.

| View      | ![Dependencies](https://img.shields.io/badge/dependencies-up%20to%20date-brightgreen) |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Markdown      | ```![Dependencies](https://img.shields.io/badge/dependencies-up%20to%20date-brightgreen)``` |

### Code Coverage: 
Represents the percentage of code covered by tests.

| View      | ![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-85%25-yellow) |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Markdown      | ```![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-85%25-yellow)``` |

### Contributors: 
Tracks the number of contributors.

| View      | ![Contributors](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributors-5-blue) |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Markdown      | ```![Contributors](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributors-5-blue)``` |

## Types of Badges

- **Static Badges**: They display fixed text or data, independent of any external system.

    Example: A "Hello World" badge:
    
    | View      | ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/hello-world-brightgreen) |
    | ----------- | ----------- |
    | Markdown      | ```![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/hello-world-brightgreen)``` |
    

- **Dynamic Badges**: They fetch real-time data from APIs or external systems. For example:

    Build status fetched dynamically from GitHub Actions: 

    | View      |   ![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/lijotech/shields-badges-repo/build.yml) |
    | ----------- | ----------- |
    | Markdown      | ```  ![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/lijotech/shields-badges-repo/build.yml)``` |

  

## Best practices for using badges effectively

When using badges in your Git repository, it’s important to strike a balance between visual appeal and functionality. Here are some best practices to keep in mind:

- **Choose Relevant Badges**
    - Only include badges that provide meaningful information about your project, such as build status, license, version, or code coverage.

    - Avoid overcrowding your README file with too many badges, which can dilute the impact.

- **Place Them Strategically**
    - Place badges at the top of the README file for quick visibility.

    - Group similar badges together (e.g., all project-related badges, like version and license, in one section).

- **Provide Clear Context**
    - Use headings or subheadings to explain what each badge represents (e.g., Build Status, License).

    - Ensure that dynamic badges (like build or test coverage) are updated to reflect the current status of your project.

- **Leverage Dynamic Badges**
    - Use dynamic badges to show real-time information, like CI/CD build status, dependency health, or downloads, to make your repository feel more professional and interactive.

    - For example, a dynamic build badge could show whether the latest commit passed CI/CD checks.

- **Use Consistent Styles**
    - Pick a consistent badge style, such as flat, plastic, or for-the-badge, to maintain a cohesive look.

- **Link to Relevant Pages**
    - Make badges clickable by linking them to relevant resources. For example:

    - Link a license badge to the full license file.

    - Link a build status badge to the build log or CI/CD system.

- **Highlight Project Maturity**
    - Use badges to indicate project stability, features, or roadmap milestones (e.g., alpha, beta, or production-ready).

- **Document Badge Usage**
    - In addition to placing badges in the README file, add a section explaining what each badge represents and how it’s dynamically updated, especially if they depend on CI/CD tools.

- **Test Badge Links**
    - Ensure that the URLs for badges and links work as intended and don’t result in errors.

- **Update Regularly**
    - Periodically review and update badges to reflect changes in your project (e.g., new licenses, improved code coverage).


## Other use cases of Badges

    Badges can enhance documentation, like wikis or user guides, by displaying the current version, build status, or coverage metrics. They act as quick status indicators for developers or readers.
